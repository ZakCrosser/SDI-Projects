/*we we all excited when told we were going to the zoo
we all wanted to see the elephants, tigers, monkeys, and the giraffes
we did get to see all of the animals we wanted to see
all of our emotions were the same when we saw the animals,
when we saw the elephants animals we stuck are toung out at them
when we saw the monkeys animals we started to laugh
when we saw the tigers animals we all made bug eyed looks at them and were scared
when we saw the giraffe animals we all wanted to ride them
we were all sad when we had to leave
when we got home dad asked us if we was the tigers we all said yes and told him how scary they were.
