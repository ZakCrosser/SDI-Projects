/*i had friends over last night and my mom said if we 
were all really good that tomorrow that she would take us to the zoo
freinds, Ian, Bob, Zak, Emily.
freinds animals wanted to see
Ian- elephants
Bob- Monkeys
Zak- tigers
Emily- Giraffe
we we all excited when told we were going to the zoo last night
we needed to get enough sleep to get to the zoo well rested
we all wanted to see the elephants, tigers, 
monkeys, and the giraffes
we were rushed but we all did get to see all of the 
animals we wanted to see
we had 1 hours total to see all the animals we wanted to see,
 and of course the animals were not even close to 
 eachother, it took 5 mins. to get to each animal house
so we each had about 10 mins. so see the animals we each 
wanted to see
all of our emotions were the same when we saw the animals,
when we saw the elephants animals we stuck are toung out at them
when we saw the monkeys animals we started to laugh
when we saw the tigers animals we all made bug eyed looks
 at them and were scared
when we saw the giraffe animals we all wanted to ride them
we were all sad when we had to leave
when we got home dad asked us if we was the tigers we all
 said yes and told him how scary they were.
